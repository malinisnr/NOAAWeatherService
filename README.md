# NOAAWeatherService

Download the jar file from Release and run using 

java -jar noaaservice/target/noaaservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 

The application will list some sample Latitude and Longitude values and ask for a prompt.
It will then call the points API to fetch the Forecast URI and display the forecast for the next 5 days.
